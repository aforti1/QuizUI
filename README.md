# QuizUI

A lightweight, browser-based multiple-choice quiz app built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Currently tailored for **COSC 311** practice, but accessible to anyone looking to review the same topics.

## ✨ Features

- All questions are multiple choice
- Questions are graded instantly on submission
- Users get a percentage score and letter grade (A–F scale)
- See which questions you got right or wrong, with correct answers shown
- Randomized order of both questions and answer choices

## 🔒 Access & Editing

- **Anyone can view and take the quiz** via the GitHub Pages link.
- **Only I can edit the quiz content**, which is hardcoded into the HTML file for now.

  - Adding new questions from within the webpage
  - Potentially hosting the app with a custom domain
